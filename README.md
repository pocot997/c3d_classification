# Person recognition based on gait captured by Motion Capture system

The repository contains code to prepare training and test sets for data acquired from the c3d motion capture system. It also contains ten algorithms for classifying this data. The code was developed for a master's thesis: "**Person recognition based on gait captured by Motion Capture system**".

**Abstract**: Motion Capture systems are an integral part of today's cinema and gaming market, but they are increasingly finding their way into other industries. Based on gait as an individual trait, it therefore made sense to use Motion Capture systems to uniquely identify people. The paper proposes and compares with each other different ways to perform motion data classification, based on different classification methods, motion parameters or input processing.
